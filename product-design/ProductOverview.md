## Executive Summary

PromptHub is a decentralized platform for creating, sharing, and monetizing AI prompts, built on the Solana blockchain. It transforms prompts from simple text instructions into programmable, composable, and monetizable digital assets. PromptHub aims to establish the first standardized marketplace for AI prompts, featuring a comprehensive suite of tools for prompt creation, testing, composition, and execution.

The platform consists of four key components:
1. **PromptHub Protocol** - On-chain smart contracts for prompt registration, licensing, and marketplace operations
2. **PromptHub MCP** - Model Context Protocol for standardized AI model interactions
3. **PromptHub SDK** - Development toolkit for integrating with the protocol
4. **PromptHub App** - Frontend application providing user interface for all platform features
